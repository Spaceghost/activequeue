== Running with Rake

The easiest way to run the unit tests is through Rake. The default task runs
the entire test suite for all classes. For more information, checkout the 
full array of rake tasks with "rake -T"

Rake can be found at http://rake.rubyforge.org

== Running Beanstalk Tests

To run the beanstalk tests you must have beanstalkd running and accessible on
localhost and 127.0.0.1 (which is usually mapped as localhost anyhow).
